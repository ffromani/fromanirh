I've been programming since the last millennium, and I've being a avid Linux user approximatively since the same time. I've a neverending passion for system and kernel programming, even though I didn't do enough of the latter. I've been mostly on the user space side of things so far. Lately I've been playing with distributed system and becoming more and more passionate about them.

I program mostly in golang, I started to look at rust and I carry a very old but still strong resolution to learn some real LISP (and finish reading my LISP books). I did quite a lot of C and python in the past, some C++, some Java and a little TCL. TCL deserved more!
I know my way in the unix shell scripting: I'm comfortable with a dark prompt and my most used graphical application is a terminal window.
I'm quite speedy with git, but I like(d) mercurial more; I used also bazaar, SVN and even CVS.

I contributed to quite a bit opensource projects. Lately I'm involved with [GHW](https://github.com/jaypipes/ghw).

I've been around thinkering with DOS to free nough conventional memory, and I experienced the 56k modem noise firsthand (and way more than once). I've been reading HOWTOs, and tried to write some.

I'm currently working at Red Hat as Software Engineer, where I do my part to improve Kubernetes/OpenShift to make sure them are great platforms for telco workloads.
